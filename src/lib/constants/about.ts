  "I discovered coding through generative art during high school, then built web and mobile apps while studying design at university. This led me to pursue computer science to deepen my understanding of theoretical foundations, such as data structures and algorithms. Currently I am doing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Technical University of Madrid, where I specialize in machine learning and its applications. With this interdisciplinary background spanning human-computer interaction to software engineering, I approach challenges with a holistic perspective.",
