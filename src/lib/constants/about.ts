  "I discovered coding through generative art during high school, then built web and mobile apps while studying design at university. This led me to pursue computer science to deepen my understanding of theoretical foundations. I now specialize in knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, and its applications. With this interdisciplinary background spanning human-computer interaction to software engineering, I approach artificial intelligence challenges with a holistic perspective.",
