  "I discovered coding through generative art during high school, then built web and mobile apps while studying design at university. This led me to pursue computer science to deepen my understanding of theoretical foundations. I now specialize in deep learning, neural networks, and their applications. With this interdisciplinary background spanning human-computer interaction to software engineering, I approach challenges with a holistic perspective.",
